        <li>Logicians are known for their brilliant theories and unrelenting logic – 
            in fact, they are considered the most logically precise of all the personality 
            types.</li>
        <li>They may appear to drift about in an unending daydream, but Logicians’ 
            thought process is unceasing, and their minds buzz with ideas from the moment 
            they wake up. </li>
        <li>The running theme for Logicians is their desire for solitude, need for 
            intellectual stimulation, and the satisfaction of the final piece of a 
            puzzle clicking into place. Whether in subordinate or management positions, 
            with colleagues or working alone, these privileges and the freedom to pursue 
            them unfettered by social obligations and progress reports are about all people 
            with the Logician personality type look for in their workplace.</li>
        <li>Though Logicians may scoff at the notion, they actually function best when 
            paired with another person. Their position determines which personality type 
            best fits their needs, but Logicians’ tendency to live in their heads and vent 
            inspiration and creativity seemingly at random demands the presence of an 
            implementer to ensure that no stroke of genius goes unnoticed.</li>
        <li>Chief among Logicians’ interests is exploring and building models for underlying 
            principles and ideas, even going so far as to find these concepts, in their own way, 
            beautiful – this makes them natural mathematicians, systems analysts, and career 
            scientists, especially in more abstract fields such as physics. There are many other 
            careers that allow Logicians to explore these interests, but many of them are far too 
            rooted in uninteresting practical applications. As useful as it is to develop a 
            better vacuum cleaner, it is no Large Hadron Collider.</li>
